Okay, maybe before we begin, you can share a bit of your experience of how you got recruited into the MN program. Okay, so I actually started my nursing in 2007. So I think the MN program was started way in 2000 somethings. I think along the years, I see my seniors actually went for that Master of Nursing program. I see them struggling, but the thing is that it's very fulfilling because the things that when they come back, the knowledge and clinical, it's not really clinical, it's just knowledge and certain aspects like understanding the same language as the doctors to some of the senior APNs, how they speak and what they do and their focus. So I get more interested on pursuing my Master of Nursing. Then the other thing is also that one of my seniors is also an APN. She's also an APN in trauma. So I did ask her that if I go, do you think that I'll be able to cope in terms of my clinical? So she said that if you're interested, actually you can because firstly, you really like clinical areas, you want to pursue further, Master of Nursing would be the correct choice that you are heading forwards to. So that's when I actually told my, not my senior, but then I did tell my APN lead that I'm actually interested. They said that, okay, they will put me at the waiting list. So once they get to, they actually send me for some pre-master course, get some trainings and if they think that I'm able to, they will send me for a course. Tell me a bit about the pre-master course. So they never really mentioned that whether I need to pass the pre-master course, but I think there is some, like in terms of theory-based learning and some clinical-based learning. So for example, like basic physical examinations and some theory progress in terms of pharmacology, in terms of some lab interpretations, as well as I think there is also some aspects of like x-rays interpretations. So it's a preparation for us to actually go for this pre-master, I mean, go for this master course. The only thing is that what they actually mentioned is that they actually want to test it on us, that how are we coping, very general things. And if you say we are able to go and be actually able to pass, should be able to go for the course. But of course, there is a side, we also have to undergo interview with our management levels. So they will actually look at us, what is our focus? Because going for Master of Nursing is very different on some of our thoughts, because we thought that, oh, just to get a certificate and you get a master, yeah, so. But the thing is that it's not that way that we should think about, because Master of Nursing as an APN, the focus is really into the areas that lack of, for example, like, sorry. So for example, like some of the, like, orthopedics trauma, you can see they need APN, Master of Nursing, APNs, all these things. So we can actually fill in the gaps. So I want to, I mean, help out in that area. So how was the selection process like? So from what I hear, you express your interest to your seniors and APN lead and your nursing leaders, then after that, how do they select that you are a good candidate for the programme? There is a few parts. I think the thing is that they will look at, because different hospitals have different kind of criteria. So for my hospital itself, actually they look at the previously how we actually work and which areas that we work and whether they feel that we really have that interest to pursue for this APN course. That's number one. Number two is they actually look at whether we are eligible based on our academic results. Yeah. Second, then third is that they also have to look at our subspecialties, where we are focusing and whether they really need people over there. Yeah. Because if you say, for example, let's say cardio per se, if you say we have two or three APNs and they filled out the gaps that is needed for that kind of support, of course getting another one, whether it's justifiable is another matter. So when they look into my areas of focus, they feel that my number looks justifiable that we need an APN to fill out the gaps. Okay. So that's where they actually put me, the list. Do you think that it is easier or more difficult for you to be selected into the MN program just because you are a male? I don't think so. You don't think it's easier or more difficult? Don't think so. Okay. So I don't think it's either difficult or actually easy because I think they look at overall, I think they look at previous records, how they fare you in terms of your clinical works. Then how much you actually have done, have contributed, what have you done. And from there, they actually know that this person is really interested in clinical areas. Because I think sometimes some of them, they are very relatively quiet. If you say they are very quiet, they don't really express themselves. They don't really do a lot of clinical works kind of things. And suddenly they actually wanted to, so they will probably want to know further how come you suddenly want to choose for that. Then there's a lot of considerations. People will tell you that this course is not easy. What makes you think that actually when you go for this course, you actually can do good for the organizations? Then it's very generic. I think they don't go by gender base. Because our hospital, we don't have much of male nurses. I mean for my batch. That's why we don't really see a lot of male nurses actually go for this master. But I personally feel that these few years, there is more male nurses actually join the scene. I'm not sure whether next time there will be more male nurses that go for this APA course. You mentioned how there isn't really, like your nursing leaders don't really consider the gender of the nurse when putting the nurse up for the MN program. But can I just ask, during the interview process or briefing, when you get selected, did they ask you about things like family planning or things pertaining to personal life? Yes, you're right. So that's one of the thoughts they want us to think about. Because when we have an interview with our management level, they did mention that when you go for this course, you have to take a lot of time out of your family time to go for your studies. And whether you have family planning or you already have a family, whether it will cause a lot of distractions, whether it will affect your studies, is one of the things that you should think about before you actually go for this course. And also the commitment that you have to do after you actually complete this course itself. I mean not just complete, but during the study, there's a lot of things that you have to Yeah, so what is it that they told you? So can you proceed to have a child? Can you proceed to, or is there like they tell you, during this at least 2 or 3 years, you have to make sure that you put all family planning on hold? That kind of thing. They never really state very clearly that you cannot plan to have a family. But they did highlight this point, sort of like, they really point out this point to a lot of people, that if let's say you don't have a kid and you are pregnant, then you have to think about it because the whole course is 18 months. So if let's say during your 9 to 10 months of during your pregnancy, I mean for ladies but for us, let's say as a husband, and if let's say your wife needs your support, then you have to think about whether you are able to cope or not. So for my part is that I have 2 kids, then they will say that whether you need to be there to guide your kids during their SM or during their studies. Then they also mention that if let's say they really need you, then how are you going to cope? This kind of things. So of course, time management is really important and family support. I mean, I think it's very important. It's that I don't notice that I can work alone, then I definitely need a family member to be down there to actually support. So this is how I actually do my management. So this thing was done more one-on-one or as a group with your female colleagues? I see, in terms of during the interview? Yeah, like this kind of briefing about saying how you have to really plan for your family and make sure that you have caregiver support. This kind of information, is it told one-on-one or in a group setting? It is actually in one to all the management level. Okay, okay. So there is quite a number of panels, interviewer that interview me alone. So before actually going for this course, our APN leads actually asked us to go in, think about it and speak to our family first. Because they do give us an overview on how these MN programs work and the curriculums. And after that, what is the next move kind of things. So they actually tell us not just during the academic years itself, but also after that, what will you be doing. So to give us an overview that when you become an APN, what kind of stressful environment that you work in. The other comment that you have to do. On the other hand, for the interviewer parts, they never reprimand me, but I think there's about 9 of them actually talk to me. Some of them did mention this point and some of them did mention when you finish your course, how are you going to contribute back to the organization. Do you think that you have it easier because you are male? I mean, considering the child family planning and caregiver issues, in your opinion, do you think you have it easier than a female? I think I am the... I'm not the one who will get pregnant. Yeah, I'm not the one who gave birth. So, because the one that carry the babies, they have to go through the 9 months. And when they have to deliver, of course, they will not be around. They are unable to carry on with their studies. So they either have to postpone it or some of them, if I say they cannot cope with their family, their kids. I'm not sure whether they need to be withdrawn. This is not part of my considerations. So, maybe what you say that is... I can say that for male will be quite different. Then, considering all that, do you think that nursing leaders somehow do take into consideration the gender of the RN when nominating him or her into the program? I don't feel that way. But sometimes, to a certain extent, it does. Because I think some of them, they wanted to have at least some mixed kind of genders. In the sense that, when we are doing meetings or anything, I think it will be coming from different aspects. I'm not really thinking that it's MF, but very generally, sometimes for a male to be down there, when we speak all these things, it can actually make the kind of environment a bit different. Can you share a bit more about that? For example, in a very tense environment, sometimes with a male staff or male APS, sometimes it can allay the anxiety, the kind of tensions during that kind of arguments. Or sometimes, some of the very strong feedbacks during the interviews, during the meetings. So what I mean by the very strong kind of feedbacks is very negative and very quite hardcore. You mean among women? Yeah, sometimes. Okay. This is what I see. What you observe. But why do you think that happens? Hmm. I think sometimes the mindset, I feel that it's a bit different. Whose mindset is different? When it comes to meetings, they have their kind of thoughts in their mind. So when they come in for the interview, it can be very short in fact. And sometimes it can be, although sometimes it's very, they try to be doing something good for the patients or as organisations, but it can actually be a negative kind of feedback during that interview itself. Yeah, and it might not be, it might be quite something unpleasant. So sometimes, for me to be down there, I feel that sometimes we try to be the middle person. Those mediate things to stop that from happening. Bring something out of the picture. Sometimes it can be a bit out of the topic, but sometimes it can actually help to stop that kind of actions. Hmm. Yeah, yeah. So you did mention about how your nursing leaders do consider the gender of the nurses because they want to make sure there's some sort of a balance between male and female in the APN group. So can you share a bit more about your institution? How is the distribution like? As in APN itself? Yeah, how is the distribution of male and female in your organisation? For the APN, I don't think so. It's now all female. There's no male APN itself. Yeah, so I personally feel that at least they can get about 30% of the male to be an APN. That would be good. Because I think sometimes we can share different ideas. And I also foresee that sometimes, you know, when we speak to, I just feel like sometimes when males speak to male doctors, all these things, it can be quite different, I feel. Yeah, so sometimes we have to settle some things. Especially there's a male APN, there might be certain things that we actually can do. Why? Why is it that when a male nurse or male APN speaks to a doctor, the effect is different from a female nurse or female APN? Okay, it is not knowledge. Because I personally feel that there's no knowledge gap in any of the APNs. It's just obvious, just gender per se. Because sometimes, you know, male and female, we feel that we are same kind of like, it's not really same kind of gender, but sometimes when we talk to each other, it can be like brother feeling kind of things. Some of the doctors itself. We quite get to know them. Yeah, and I don't think there is like kind of gender gaps. I feel, yeah. So I'm not sure how other people feel. This is sometimes what I do observe. But not for all. Then how do you feel about your interaction with female doctors? You know, your observation is that males, nurses, maybe you can connect better with male doctors, easier to communicate because of similar gender and all that. So then with female doctors, do you observe the same phenomena? Yes, I think I do. Because when I talk to female doctors, it's really work-based discussions. So it's quite hard to talk about. Sometimes, because when we talk about too serious things, sometimes we can talk out of topic stuff with male doctors or some of the male DPS. But when it comes to different genders, sometimes we just focus on talking about, focusing on the work-based stuff. And the feeling is different. Because when you talk about, sometimes out of blue, you talk about other things. You feel that it's not too stressed, not too bad. I feel that some of the doctors when I talk to my senior APNs, I can observe that as well. They don't worry, they don't talk out of topic things. They really focus on the work-based stuff. And that's it. So they don't try to build a rapport with the female APNs? You're trying to say that? Maybe sort of. Or it's just colleagues. Relationship. Just now you mentioned that in your organisation, there isn't any male APNs yet. So you will probably be the first APN after your successful completion. I hope. Why do you think that there is such few male APNs in your organisation? Because I've been in my organisation for about 13 years as I mentioned to you. So far at my level, we don't have much of a male nurses. And I don't know, a lot of them, after a while, they like to actually focus on other areas. Not really clinical. Some of them, they like to focus maybe to management level or maybe to IT stuff. You were talking about this level. Can you maybe explain what this level means? As in, my organisation, we at least need assistant nurse clinicians to have the so-called chance to enroll for this Master of Nursing course. So when I talk about this level, I talk about assistant nurse clinicians and above. We don't have much of a male assistant nurse clinician or nurse clinicians per se. Yeah, so if let's say we do, some of them is relatively quite some of them, I think we have few one or two that is 50 plus or over 60 years old. I don't think they will want to go for that. Yeah, so as I mentioned as my level, I don't have much of a male nurse clinicians or assistant nurse clinicians currently. Yeah, on my level, on my organisation itself. So are you suggesting that men are generally less interested in becoming APNs or going on to the clinical track? I feel so. Why? I'm not sure whether it's because of the studies, or maybe some of them, although they know that they want to go for their Masters, but then the thing is that if you say they go for Management, they can do a part-time Masters. They don't need to do a full-time Masters They don't have to keep studying. And maybe to a certain age, 30 term Nation might not be there or they have family, some of them might be so breadwinners. If they go back to study, they will worry that if they are able to do well in their academics, whether it can be a problem. Then, yeah, I feel that way. So in your observation, most of your male colleagues that seek further development, they go into mainly Management or IT. Is there any other areas that attract them? I feel that there's also another areas that probably they feel a bit inferior, in the sense that because it's, I mean, nursing is always female dominance. When it comes to, because they want to go for higher levels, they go for meetings. I feel that we don't really talk much per se, because it's really a female dominance. So sometimes we can be, we feel that sometimes we say some things, people might not really hear us or actually take note of what we actually mention. So that is one of the things that I feel. Why though? Does it happen to you? It doesn't. Sometimes we, yeah, but when we have a meeting, all these things not very close with the female management level. Maybe it's the gender gap itself. The comfortable kind of feelings. Yeah, because when you one of the males to so many females, sometimes they might want to speak among themselves or certain things, they might not be very comfortable. Okay, so because it's such a female dominated environment for a male to speak up you feel that it's a challenge for some people. Yup. Okay. So apart from the need to go back to, because you spoke of some barriers, right, that deters men from entering the APN track one of which is the need to go back to study. The next one would be because they are so breadwinners, they are afraid that they might not complete and then cannot end up being an APN then waste time, right? The second one would be is the third one something like waiting too long is it? Because on the management track you can do a part-time masters. Yeah, so sometimes the waiting, because I don't feel that it's because of gender per se that you know, males tend to take longer gap, I don't think so. Yeah. I'm not sure about previously because I don't have that kind of experience. So the thing is that after so many years, because sometimes you get your degree, it might be because for me, I didn't get my degree maybe 7 or 8 years back after it suddenly when you maybe your management think that do you want to go for, offer you for the APN course itself, it might be 7 or 8 years later then 7 years that you never touch any clinical theories like your textbook how things you tend not to, because you are scared that whether you are able to cover Yeah, so that is one of the things. Then after that, some of them they are waiting for the versions as what you see from my side so after getting to promote maybe they are planning for a family, then they will consider whether I need to study whether I need to plan for family although I'm not the one who get pregnant or give birth but I do have to support my family or my wife then they will probably not go for that In your observation or based on what you know do you think that there are any other existing barriers that would stop men from pursuing the APN career track? Let me think about it I think maybe it's just that some of them are not interested in studying Yeah, so this is APN track is very clinical and very theory based learning so just based on that facts some of them might not actually want to pursue for that because why they want to waste their I mean not really waste but why they think about it make them suffer for 18 months and after that they still have to suffer some more because it's not the end of it some of them is like you study already that's it, you get a certain but APN is different you study that is just your basic but you have to get to know more then you have to build up yourself yeah, so it's very different but in terms of when they go for management go to IT, IT is something that they are interested in they don't deal with they can learn some IT stuff and play around which I think maybe they don't like to do that management wise, you just get a cert but management, you don't really touch clinical you don't really need to learn it's based on your experience because management is that once you get all these things maybe you have some kind of kind of like fairly basic understanding of certain management stuff but it comes to your level of kind of seniorities and experience it's true experience it doesn't really need to go through all these kind of process that you have to go to up to date read up what is the current medical management kind of things on this particular diseases so I feel that it's different so that's maybe one of the aspects that you might not want to go for this hmmm so it seems like men just generally are not interested in this track huh hmmm that's interesting I don't know whether they are really interested in nursing per se because sometimes we do have some of them that they join because I feel that now the current career is that you definitely will not be jobless that is one it might be across everyone but sometimes if you make a meal to join there might be some of their thoughts as well do you have friends or batchmates from poly or your degree that somehow has become APN or also interested in APN track it's not my batchmate but it's my friend that has already been an APN I mean male right? yeah it's a male what is their driving reason for wanting to pursue the APN track is it similar to yours? it's the interest his focus is other areas so his focus is psych mental health it's something that actually drive him to go and pursue for APN so I guess you will agree that there is an under-representation of male in the APN workforce definitely but do you think that it is important to have more men in the APN workforce yes because if I'm really become APN I hope that there is some male APNs that we can share some ideas I feel that it's more comfortable yeah I don't know I just feel that it's different I don't know how to express it but maybe when we talk we somehow don't understand our language we understand each other so apart from you having a support system personally but in general maybe for your organisation or the entire Singapore per se how would having more men in APN be important or beneficial or you think it's not necessary at all I personally feel that it's definitely required because currently we still need nurses so I mean we do have a lot of female nurses that join but I think male nurses do can contribute as well so just say they see more APNs I think it can drive people to join this career actually because a lot of people myself as of now still feel that as a nurse it's just to do basic care they do not know that actually we do more than that so it's not, it's really underrepresented so if you see we do have a lot of male nurses and we can present ourselves and let people know that what we do I feel that it actually can get more male nurses to enroll for this course so definitely it will be very beneficial and it will add on to the manpower Why is it then that I mean what I'm trying to understand from what you shared and infer from what you shared is that it is more impactful for a man or male nurse to represent the nursing profession to increase recruitment of men so why is it that it wouldn't have that same effectiveness if it's a female APN I think all along is I think across the entire world is that as a nurse I'm not sure maybe in more developed in Europe or in US countries that further gender is no longer an issue but I think in Asian countries I think this is still a kind of mindset that I feel like of course maybe Taiwan China all these things being a nurse is still a female dominance work yeah and the thing is that it actually is not just that because when we actually handle a lot of patients itself actually it's not that simple we need some kind of force or our kind of male to actually help out in some of the environments itself so it does and we do have a lot of male patients itself and definitely there is areas for the males nurses to actually work on these areas and also it becomes if we have more male nurses it would be sort of like not really female dominance it would be across every very general based workforce yeah and maybe it would be different yeah so you spoke about how there are areas where male nurses or male APNs can do well in what are these areas? so maybe I could give you examples for example when I handle a violent patient itself in the block so definitely how strong a female is sometimes they might not be able to cook so sometimes they really need some meal when patients see a male staff it's quite different they might not be as rough as how they actually approach the female staff why? I feel that sometimes this is what I observe if you are being threatened if you see a male staff they will step aside rather than they feel that they are superior than a female so they will like sort of like become more violent because sometimes when we handle certain cases in the ward, sometimes they see a male they really step aside this is what I observe yeah and sometimes we call some of the male PROs they see a lot of males they step aside so sometimes the patients or whatever they feel that the female is much stronger hmm so and of course females they also are worried but mentality is also different sometimes when we handle things, we feel that when they punch us maybe it's their fault females are worried that they are frightened or they are worried that they will get assaulted yeah it can be very bad yeah and some of them are pregnant or maybe they do not know whether they are pregnant they feel that they might be so it can it's quite dangerous hmm that's a very good example hmm so apart from all these right do you think there are any other reasons why it's important for men, for more men to enter the workforce, the APN workforce specifically yeah so the thing is that I personally feel that because I don't have this kind of experience because I'm still studying, I can't really foresee that but what I can really see is as I mentioned just now earlier if you see there's an APN in the workforce, more APNs as a male it can actually encourage our juniors that in clinical you see your seniors actually can do very well and they really project well in their it's not really status but in terms of career path, all these things for males sometimes you have families career path is very important they will know that it doesn't stop there they still can go for this and they can actually do more than what they have been actually doing currently now we have restrictions right we sort of more independent in terms of certain management things although we still have to discuss with our clinical supervisors then we have more autonomy so this is some of the also a character because when you hear about some autonomy per se, sometimes it can attract our juniors so why do you think that career progression is more important to men than women I mean that's what I'm hearing what you're saying correct me if I'm wrong I think maybe it's a I'm not sure whether it's a men thing because when we have family we definitely want to be the sole breadwinner per se to take care of the family so financial is also one of the things everyone thinks is that you'll get promoted your career advancement your salary all these things will get better then at least we have that kind of financial support to our family members so if you just say you're a person that you're stuck at certain levels you cannot advance some of them might feel very inferior they feel that they might not be able to support the family can you comment a bit about the APN remuneration and do you think that will be something that will determine from entering the APN workforce in terms of numbers per se the amount of bonuses is it? remuneration like the pay the pay of APN so yeah can you comment a bit about it also do you think that the APN pay is a factor that encourages or deters men from entering the workforce I would not say the salary itself but a lot of people feel that when they actually get boss certificates then they actually get more because when you go for the levels it's like you get the promotion part as well then you got more chance to get promote to a certain different levels so I would not say 100% but it does affect a certain aspect maybe about percentage is about 30-40% you mean to become an APN your pay would increase by about 30-40% not the pay but in terms of the salary itself you can attract about 30-40% I mean based on one of the pointers like in terms of your salary 30-40% of the boy the male will think about they will actually pursue further for pursue their APN careers the salary increment it's not that significant so do you think that is why men do not want to enter the workforce? it's possible it's also possible because some of them feel that I actually study for so much there's only certain amount that I actually get whereas if I did my compare if I actually you know work after a while I'm quite tired it's still this amount maybe that certain percentage increment if I go elsewhere private settings the salary might be very different or they actually quit they probably think work after a while they feel that I'm tired I want to try other things that might be one of the kind of problems that can arise from male nurse coming to the workforce but in terms of APN wise I will say that currently as what you say when they see them when they see seniors male nurses become APN some of them really like clinical and they feel that there's more autonomy they might want to go for this course they might not really consider about salary so this might drive them to go for this course but some of them might not I spent so many years just be APN but my salary is just like that they will feel that why I want to raise all this what about for you is paying a consideration when you enter this course do you think about it and do you calculate and see is this something that I can live with for X number of years because I understand there will be a salary freeze I mean it's stagnant for a while because you have to complete your internship and everything, pass your exams it won't be salary freeze, you will still get your sorry hello sorry just now suddenly cut off I repeat my question for you, did you consider pay and all that when entering the programme to a certain extent, yes so the things that I do ask my senior but it's very sensitive when it comes to salary I will roughly ask them roughly how much will you actually get once you graduate from this course itself how much will your salary increment be and on top of that, is there any additional kind of allowance so it's not significant though but the advancement it matters some people are looking at short some are looking at long run so I'm looking at long run because if you want to go for career advancement base as a I mean your basic requirement you need to have a master programme that's one part, but second aspect is why I actually end up going for this course yes, it's not easy a lot of people say that you have to mentally prepare for that, but on the other hand, I like clinical so if there's a clinical advancement this is another career that I need to go for so that thoughts brought me to go for this but it does sound like you did some background check before you enrolled yourself you did some research and market research so it means it's important to you, right? it's important because to a certain age to a certain level you will definitely have some different thoughts maybe when you just joined not long ago, you have that because other hospitals might not require to be assistant nurse for you to get a chance some of them they just have at least 5 years of experience and you expressed interest that you're going to go they will go and some of these I would say that these students maybe they are not married they do not have families maybe they are in their 20s maybe late 20s so their thoughts might be different as well I feel career is another thing so yes the amount that they get now is a bit not that much but they think about that I got all these things, I'm not afraid if I do well, I can get more chance equally I can get the amount that I actually want so it really depends on the life stage of that particular nurse, right? yeah, I feel that's a very good point do you think that having more men in the APN workforce has an influence on the professional image of nursing in Singapore? I feel so it let people feel that it's equivalent it's not really female dominance because now if you see there's a lot of new nurses join the workforce so people will change totally and maybe some of the patients will prefer a female nurse same thing, male and female when they talk is different, they feel more comfortable they feel that there's no they don't feel that there's really a gap they might want to share more sometimes some of the new patients when they try to talk to a female they feel that they might not understand him this is some of my experience so they don't really want to share with them but when it comes to a male, when they share more they feel that we understand them so it does make a difference so when you're APN, it's a male when you attend the patients itself the male patients will feel that this particular male nurses do know a lot of things it can make a lot of impact when they share with their families you're going to join a nursing workforce I actually encountered one of the male nurses he can manage me very well this is not a bad career so this can be part of things that can impact the society do you then think that based on your experience being male it's easier to be more outstanding compared to your female nurses so maybe you can in a general ward or whichever work setting you're in you're doing the same thing as your female colleagues you're performing as effective but patients or your other professional colleagues will notice you more do you have that kind of feeling? I think so yes, yes when I first joined as a nursing career it's a male ward because the dominance is always female suddenly you have one or two female coming the environment is very different they will tease on us but they will remember us and sometimes they will get us to help them so then do you think because of that your career progression can be faster than a female I don't think so I feel that everyone is equivalent because sometimes it's a person's character whether you're male or female if your character is bad I don't think it will make changes in terms of gender but in terms of good characters male and female both of them are very good I think male might shine more because they might hardly see a male that shines I feel but when you listen back to the audio I feel the lack but for yourself as a junior nurse and you became more senior your process, because you have already jumped a few levels as you jumped do you feel that you were given more opportunities because you are male compared to your female colleagues or you think it's just down to your personality and character I think it's based on character and attitude because the attitude itself is very important whether you're male or female as I mentioned if you start with a very bad attitude no matter whether you're male or female you will not be I don't think we're going to send you for anything but if you say your attitude is good maybe based on myself I feel that yes, probably I might be set for more things You mentioned that in your organisation the minimum requirement to enter the MN course is ANC so now you are ANC is there any reason for a delay that you will not send when you are ANC? I think it's because of the organisation it's not organisation but department's requirement because for my areas I do have one APN so they wanted to send those that are without APN and there is a service need then they will send them first because when there is a service need they want the APN to be there to help out I think it's also let people know that APN from that particular area can do well so it's different So generally speaking maybe let's think about your institution how do you think you can improve the recruitment of men into the APN profession? I think first of all we have to have enough people to come to hospital male nurses to enroll to hospital first if not then we don't even have a chance to identify or actually to build up those male nurses for this course itself second thing is that local nurses local male nurses I'm not sure whether other hospitals there is an increasing numbers we do see quite a fair bit of foreign nurses if they are not PR or Singapore citizens I think at least PR or Singapore citizens they are not eligible to enroll I mean we talk about APN not even advanced diploma so that will be a disadvantage of them but of course I think government is doing so so that they can allow local or PRs to actually get the chance to go for this so currently my hospital we have new nurses but mostly foreign talent we have locals one but so far they haven't really expressed but if I say next time when I go back maybe I can identify some of them and talk to them because I think it's also I'm not sure about whether they know how far, how much about this programme itself or they get someone to ask about this programme but if I say when I go back and some of them there is a male nurses they are interested on this at least they can push then they can actually talk about it maybe we can see a change so are you suggesting that having more male APNs being role models will actually help improve the recruitment I think to get more male nurses to join APN it does we don't talk about female because I think female doesn't really affect much but I think male itself it does because sometimes some of them might ask us like when we have family all these things because I have a junior that is interested in APNs but I'm studying so he might want to start his family so this is one of his considerations because how long does he need to wait because you can see he said that try not to plan for family you know your plan for family is not just plan like that there is a lot of considerations so for them this is one of the things they might want to check and they also might want to ask about go for this course how you feel what kind of support that is needed career advancements, opportunity all these things they might also want to ask before they actually go for it unless there is a group of male nurses that they don't have any things to worry about then that might not be they might be the one that they are interested in taking a course that might be some of them will be like that which areas or specialty do you think male APNs will play a significant role in healthcare that's a very good question something that they will do better than female I don't know but I just feel that trauma is one of the aspect why? because a lot of we enter a lot of bloody stuff not a lot of females will like it then we see bony things that are protruding out we have to sometimes carry the patients and they are not small size and maybe certain areas will be like I think community might not be because community for male might be a bit difficult if they hand a female patient they might encounter some issues but then other areas probably some medical wards orthopedics orthopedics for male might be a bit different but generally other things I don't think it's a big issue it's not a big issue in your current work setting, auto trauma where you are in a high dependency can you take care of female patients? for young for young patients unless certain things that we have to then we need to get all these things to be in for us at ED because we don't handle young patients but we have everyone around and our focus is to save the patients but if it's a well patient usually we don't unless to a certain extent when this patient turns violent then we have no choice to eat it but general examinations just our eye noticing we don't do a physical examination on female patients do you foresee yourself facing some challenges when you pass out as a full-fledged APN and operate your service in auto in auto auto trauma so maybe you share a bit more about the service that you will provide first then the service is still not finalised yet so what happens is that previously before I joined I was just a trauma nurse so what we do is that we actually attend trauma-attending patients do ward rounds with my orthopedist herself then we do our own patients in terms of setting tractions handling some coordinating works and do some examination on the patients but for orthopedic trauma the focus is almost like doing trauma works but then it will be more on orthopedic stuff like if let's say get more experience might run some of the auto clinics on certain areas focus so maybe for example like those elderly cases that non-surgery look into whether the unions of the bones part there may be some of the things that we can consider and work on that to put an APS to see these patients but I haven't really finalised everything but do you foresee that you being a male will have some problems with whatever service that you are going to provide inpatient I feel yes maybe for elderly they might not know that they might think that I am a doctor but then sometimes I tell them APN nurse or this thing because they are elderly, they are ok we just get a fracture problem but then for young one, if you see they ask young male nurses all these things, they will not be very comfortable so we do foresee this will be issues but other than that I don't think much of you just now briefly mentioned that community will be an area that wouldn't be very suitable for male APN can you explain a bit more I do not know whether I am right just feel that because when we are deployed out to the community because when you do APN you can do physical examinations so sometimes physical examinations can it be something that cause a problem as a male APN people thought that we are actually more or less that kind of thing we do not know sometimes if say they deploy one staff itself you do not have anyone around to jump on you then it will be very difficult then you have to call someone to help you or if you encounter an environment that you need to go to the home maybe it is not an old one but with some injuries or whichever you need to go for a community review then we might not do a physical examination on them but when we do some like a wound management on them, sometimes whether people are comfortable with is also another thing that we do not know yeah, that's true so then this would probably be a disadvantage of having a male in APN in nursing practice right? yeah, correct so I do not see any male I am not sure about other hospitals but in my areas I do not see any male community nurse maybe there is one I am not sure whether they have partners I think there is one or two but I am not sure whether they have partners yeah, in the end instead of one nurse go, you have like two going, that would be like additional manpower yeah so this is a disadvantage of having male in APN practice what are other advantages? are there advantages? you spoke about their brute strength so they are very suitable for orthopedics but is there other specialties that you think A&E A&E definitely so A&E we see all sort of professions like you know, manage certain, I mean we don't talk about violence but I talk about maybe in terms of resuscitation new APNs that will be good the environment and sometimes they speak up all these things it can be quite dominant so A&E will be quite a good place anywhere else? Psychiatric mental health patients yeah I think that's why a lot of mental health APNs or quite a number of them is male they are male APNs yeah so that's also another areas I have asked you all the questions that I have but before I end do you have any other comments that you want to make regarding having men in APN practice or recruiting men into APN practice? not really the thing is that I just feel that if they feel that they are suitable, I think they should just go in for this course don't regret but of course it's very stressful when it comes to because we have expectations of our academic results definitely there is a requirement that is the most stressful part a lot of them are worried that whether when you cannot go through, you fail yeah the amount that you have to pay back yeah yeah so that's one aspect but second aspect is that if you think about it, you actually do a lot learn a lot of things that you never come across with yeah and they are very useful tools and the learning parts of objectives that we actually go through and it can actually bring it back to your organisation yeah so it's encouraging for people to do for that okay, thank you so much I will end the recording now
